# Node.js Hello API

This is an example application to show how easy is to use the SPHERE.IO API using an Express.js application.

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli && npm install
$ grunt serve
```

> The source code is written in `coffeescript`, if you want to see the `javascript` version simply execute `grunt build` and look at the `lib` folder.
